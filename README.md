Fullstack hour logging application with MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
<h2>How to run:</h2>
npm install on both folders client and server
You also need a MongoDB database named location. After you have that just add your own connection string to server/index.js
my connect string looks like this for example (mongodb+srv://"user":"password"@"cluster".mongodb.net/location?retryWrites=true&w=majority)
use npm run devStart to run backend, npm start for the frontend
<h2>What does it do:</h2>
Simply you select a date, locations and log hours for each location. then you can see your past logs.
