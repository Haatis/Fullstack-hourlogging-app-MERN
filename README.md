# Fullstack-hourlogging-app-MERN
Fullstack hour logging application with MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
How to run: npm install on both folders client and server
You also need a MongoDB database named location with a table named locationData. After you have that just add your own connection string to server/index.js
my connect string looks like this for example (mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/location?retryWrites=true&w=majority)
use npm run devStart to run backend, npm start for the frontend
